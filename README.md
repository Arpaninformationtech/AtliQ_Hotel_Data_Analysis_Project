# AtliQ_Hotel_Data_Analysis_Project
üöÄ Hospitality Domain Data Analysis Project Completed! üöÄ

Excited to share the results of my latest project in Hospitality Data Analysis using Python! üè®üìä

Key Highlights:

Gained valuable insights into the Hospitality Industry, understanding and calculating crucial KPIs and Industry-specific indicators.(like ADR,REVPAR,DURN,DBRN,DSRN ,REALISATION % ,AVG RATING, CANCELLATION %etc.).

Cleaned and analyzed booking data, identifying outliers and ensuring data integrity.

Merged datasets, creating a unified view for a comprehensive analysis.

Utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for powerful data manipulation and visualization.

Insights Obtained:

ADR (Average Daily Rate): ADR from direct-offline and tripster platform is higher.ADR across week is quite stable. In weekend ADR is higher than weekday.

Realisation %: Realisation % is almost same acroos booking platform and properties.

Occupancy %:In week 20 Occupancy % was higher.

Revenue Breakdown by Categories:Luxary hotels contribute 68 % of total revenue.

Week-wise Performance:

Explored the trends in Occupancy %, REVPAR, and ADR over different weeks.

Property-wise Analysis:

Investigated performance metrics for each property, uncovering insights on their Revenue, ADR, and Realisation %,DBRN,DSRN,DURN,AVG RATING,CANCELLATION%,REALISATION%

Room Class Revenue Breakdown:

Visualized the contribution of each room class to the overall revenue.

Lessons Learned:

Overcame challenges in data cleaning and outlier detection, reinforcing my data analysis skills.

Enhanced my ability to interpret and communicate data-driven insights to inform strategic decision-making.

Improved proficiency in Python, Pandas, and data visualization techniques.
