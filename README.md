## Key Highlights:

- Gained valuable insights into the Hospitality Industry, calculating crucial KPIs and industry-specific indicators (ADR, REVPAR, DURN, DBRN, DSRN, REALISATION %, AVG RATING, CANCELLATION %, etc.).

- Cleaned and analyzed booking data meticulously, identifying outliers and ensuring data integrity.

- Merged datasets seamlessly to create a unified view for a comprehensive analysis.

- Utilized the power of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for robust data manipulation and insightful visualization.

## Insights Obtained:

### ADR (Average Daily Rate):

- ADR from direct-offline and Tripster platform is higher.
- ADR remains stable across the week, with higher values during weekends.

### Realisation %:

- Realisation % is consistently maintained across booking platforms and properties.
